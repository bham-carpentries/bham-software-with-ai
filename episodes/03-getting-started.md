::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this episode we'll look at installing and setting up Copilot within Visual Studio Code,
so we can use it with our example project,
and explore some basic features along the way.

## Install VSCode Copilot Extension

Extensions are a major strength of VSCode.
Whilst VSCode appears quite lightweight, and presents a simple interface (particularly compared to many other IDEs!), this is quite deceptive.
You can extend its functionality in many different ways. 
For example, installing support for other languages, greater support for version control, there's even support for working with databases, and so on.
There are literally tens of thousands of possible extensions now.

You may remember when you opened VSCode for this project there was a "Build with Agent" panel on the right.
This is the main chat interface to Copilot.
But in order to use it (and other Copilot features) we need to install some extensions first.
It's possible to have VSCode manage the installation of these extensions automatically,
but we'll do this explicitly so you see the explicit changes necessary to get it working.

1. Firstly, select the extensions icon, then type in "Copilot" into the search box at the top, and it'll give you a list of all Copilot-related extensions.
1. Select the one which says `GitHub Copilot` from Microsoft, which is the Microsoft official Copilot extension. You may also see the `GitHub Copilot Chat` extension, which will be automatically installed along with this one.
1. Select `Install`. It might take a minute - you can see a sliding blue line in the top left to indicate it's working.
1. You'll be presented with a "Welcome" page for the extension which covers the main features. Select `Mark Done`.

Now we have the extension installed, but we need to associate it with our GitHub account by signing in:

1. Select the `Signed out` button in the bottom right of the VSCode status bar, and `Sign in to use AI Features`.
1. Select `Continue with GitHub`.
1. You'll be redirected to a GitHub login web page to authorise Visual Studio Code for GitHub. Select the GitHub account you wish to use and select `Continue`.
1. Peruse and select `Authorize Visual-Studio-Code`.
1. You may need to further authenticate with GitHub authorise this action.
1. If a pop-up appears in your browser to open a link within VSCode, select `Open Link`.

Once completed, you'll now be able to use GitHub Copilot within VSCode.

## Asking Questions about Your Code

Attempting to understand a new codebase, whether it's your first week on a project or one you have inherited from another source, can be difficult. 
This can be due to many reasons; documentation may be incomplete, architectural decisions may be undocumented,
and the people who know the system may be unavailable or have left the organisation.

We can use Copilot to build our understand and confidence about our codebase by asking natural-language questions about the code. It helps you:

- Build a high-level mental model of the system, which with complex codebases is often a huge task!
- Identify where key functionality is located in the code
- Understand naming conventions, patterns, and dependencies
- Reduce the cognitive load of first contact with unfamiliar code

Which sounds great, but with one critical caveat:
it's important to understand that Copilot is not an absolute source of truth,
but more of a guide to help build your own understanding of a codebase.

Let's use Copilot to help us investigate how our existing codebase works.

### Using Copilot for the First Time

Let's move over to using the VSCode pane on the right, labeled `Build with Agent`.
You'll notice at the bottom there's a "chat" box,
with a number of selectable dropdown options below it.
You can hover over each one to discover what it is.

On the left, there's `Set Agent`, which allows you to set the mode of operation with Copilot.
Each of these modes provides an increasing degree of autonomy for Copilot to interact with your code:

- `Ask` - designed for learning and orienting yourself with existing code without changing it.
- `Edit` - proposes concrete code changes for your approval based on your instructions. It's useful when you already understand a codebase that you want to change.
- `Agent` - the most powerful mode, which lets you specify a high-level prompt to allow Copilot at a high level of autonomy to plan changes in steps, select files, and run tools or terminal commands, iterating on code edits until it is complete.

Since we want to ask questions regarding our codebase, let's set the mode to `Ask`.

The next dropdown is the AI language model being used.
By default, this is set to `Auto` so that Copilot will decide the model.
However, for consistency in this training, let's select the entry for `Claude Haiki 4.5`.

Select the `inflammation-plot.py` file in the File Explorer.

Let's now ask the very high level question: `What does this code do?`, and press enter.
You'll likely be asked whether you want to enable Claude Haiku 4.5 for all clients - select `Enable` when prompted.

You'll find the response looks something like the following:

```
This code generates visualization plots for inflammation data:

1. Loads data files: Uses glob to find all CSV files matching the pattern inflammation-*.csv in the ../data/ directory, sorts them, and limits processing to the first 3 files.

2. Processes each file: For each CSV file, it:
   - Loads the data as a NumPy array using comma delimiters
   - Creates a figure with 3 subplots arranged horizontally

3. Generates three plots showing statistical summaries across patients (rows):
   - Left plot: Average inflammation values per day
   - Middle plot: Maximum inflammation values per day
   - Right plot: Minimum inflammation values per day

4. Saves output: Each figure is saved as a PNG file with the same name as the input CSV file plus .png extension.
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

## Why Aren't I Seeing the Same Response?

You'll likely find it's not exactly the same.
Due to the ways in which LLMs process requests, based on an iterative probabilistic model,
responses based on the same question will show differences:
so essentially, AI models are *probablistic*, not *deterministic*.
This effect is often visibly compounded over time, as the probabilistic outcome of a response generates an increasingly different result.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

## How to Write Good Chat Prompts?

AI tools work best with context, so it's good to be specific where you can.

To add context to a chat prompt you can type `#` followed by the context item you want to add,
such as a file, folder, tools, code elements (such as variables, functions or classes), tools, amongst others.
For example, we could type `#inflammation-plot.py` to ensure only responses relevant to that specific file will be generated.
Alternatively, we could use `#codebase` if we aren't sure which files are relevant to our question.

It's also a good idea to be provide simple questions,
so if you end up with a question that is decomposable into separate steps,
ask each step separately and you'll typically get a better outcome.
This implies that it's good to use a logical, iterative process of using AI to assist,
using responses to simple questions to inform the next question, and so on.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## What do I Need to Know?

5 mins.

Ask the following questions about the code:

1. What are the main packages used?
2. How is Matplotlib used to generate the plots?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

1. Describe the main packages used? e.g.

```
1. glob: Built-in Python module for file pattern matching
   - glob.glob() finds all files matching a wildcard pattern (inflammation-*.csv)
   - Useful for batch processing multiple files with consistent naming

2. numpy: Numerical computing library
   - np.loadtxt() loads CSV data into a NumPy array
   - data.mean(axis=0), data.max(axis=0), data.min(axis=0) compute statistics across patients (rows) for each day (columns)

3. matplotlib.pyplot: Plotting library for creating visualizations
   - plt.figure() creates a new figure window
   - fig.add_subplot() adds subplots to the figure
   - axes.set_ylabel() and axes.plot() configure and draw the plots
   - fig.tight_layout() optimizes spacing
   - fig.savefig() exports the figure as an image file

These three packages work together: glob finds the files, numpy processes the data, and matplotlib visualizes the results.
```

2. How is Matplotlib used to generate the plots? e.g.

```
This script uses Matplotlib to create and save visualization plots:

1. Create a figure: plt.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0)) creates a new figure with dimensions 10 inches wide by 3 inches tall.

2. Add subplots: fig.add_subplot(1, 3, n) creates a grid of 1 row and 3 columns, with n specifying which subplot (1, 2, or 3):
   - axes1, axes2, axes3 are the three subplot axes objects

3. Label and plot data:
   - axes.set_ylabel() adds a label to the y-axis
   - axes.plot() draws a line plot of the data on that subplot
   - Each subplot shows a different calculation: mean(), max(), and min()

4. Layout adjustment: fig.tight_layout() automatically adjusts spacing between subplots to prevent overlap.

5. Save output: fig.savefig() saves the entire figure as a PNG image file.
```

Due to the ambiguous nature of language and how we specify prompts,
and the nature of how LLMs operate and generate responses,
as we have seen, we'll fairly typically have overlaps in responses to multiple questions.
Again, therefore, the key is to isolate what's useful,
and drill down and be increasingly specific on questioning until we have what we need
(as we would in an a typical conversation).

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

## Why Aren't I Seeing the Same Results for the Same Question?

Sometimes, you may ask the same question and get a different response.

As we've mentioned, LLMs are non-deterministic,
in that the same question can produce different answers.
In addition to it's probablistic nature, there are other reasons for these differences:

- Context-dependent: small changes in files, cursor position, or prompt matter
- Approximate understanding: infers intent, doesn't fully "understand" the codebase
- Model changes over time: behaviour can shift as Copilot and it's underlying models are updated

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Personalising Copilot to Match our Project

### What is an Instructions File?

GitHub Copilot can be personalised by adding a instructions file to a repository that tells Copilot how you want it to behave in that project.

The file acts as standing, project-level guidance for Copilot, covering things like:

- Preferred architecture and design patterns
- Coding style and naming conventions
- Approved or banned libraries
- Testing expectations and quality standards
- Security or safety rules
- How detailed Copilot’s answers should be

By giving Copilot this shared context we can specify the developer's (or developer team’s) coding conventions, reuse existing patterns, and avoid unwanted approaches, with the aim to make its suggestions more relevant for a particular project.

It serves a similar purposes to a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in a code repository;
it provides guidance for how suggestions, code changes and contributions should be made,
but aimed at Copilot's day-to-day decisions instead.
It does this by adding context to queries from the `.github/.copilot-instructions.md` file.

For example, if we were to ask Copilot "How should I make this code more readable?",
without instructions Copilot may suggest to:

- Rename or format variable or function names inconsistently
- Change behaviour subtly in an undesired way
- Use an indentation style that isn't typically used by team members
- Without instructions, Copilot may introduce a new design pattern the repository doesn't use

### Create an Instructions File

Let's create an instructions file now, by selecting the gear icon at the top right of the `CHAT` panel,
and selecting `Generate Chat Instructions`.
At this point, VSCode will do a number of things in order to create this file:

1. Analyse the structure and files in the workspace
1. Analyse the data directory `data/` which contains our inflammation data files
1. Create the `.github/.copilot-instructions.md` file itself
1. Summarise the contents of the new instructions file
1. Provide some questions for feedback to add more specific guidance in the instructions file

Note that it may request access to run a Bash command in the `data` directory,
from which it can then ascertain the structure of the data,
which you'll have to approve.

We'll look at the contents of the file in a moment.

You may also see some feedback questions, such as:

```
1. Should I add more detail about the other datasets (climate data, coordinates), or keep focus only on the inflammation data workflow?
2. Are there specific Python version requirements or package versions that should be documented?
3. Would you like guidance on handling edge cases (e.g., what happens with empty CSV files, missing columns)?
```

### Working with our Instructions File

You should now see a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file appear in VSCode's file browser.
If you open this file now, you'll see some things to note:

- Content is highlighted with a `Keep / Undo` option.
This is VSCode's way of highlighting the changes Copilot has made as suggestions,
so that you explicitly review and approve them.
- Directory names may appear strangely located (e.g. `../data/`), since these are file references relative to the location of the instructions file.
- A summary of the main code entry point, the data source directory, and the overall workflow of the application
- A section on the code patterns and conventions, essentially generalising how the code works and providing assumptions on how it operates, e.g. `axis=0 consistently means aggregate across rows (patients), preserving measurement dimensions`
- Some suggestions on how to refactor (tidy) the codebase and otherwise enhancement it

Approve this file addition by selecting `Keep`.

From this starting point we are free to update this file manually as we continue to develop the code,
and this context will be used whenever we interact with Copilot.

## Obtaining Guidance on how to Improve our Code

Now have an instructions file to guide Copilot,
let's take its guidance one step further.
So far we've been asking quite specific questions about this codebase in order to learn more about it.
But let's now consider we might want to do to improve it.

Looking at the code, you may already have your own ideas for how it could be improved,
but let's ask Copilot instead.
Another aspect we haven't looked into yet is the other available AI models we can use.
So far we've only used the `Claude Haiku 4.5` model,
but there are others at time of writing selectable from the models dropdown:
essentially some variants of GPT, and a Raptor model preview.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

## What's the 'x' Figure Displayed Next to Each Model?

Next to each model you'll see an `x` figure, e.g. `1x`.
This is a multiplier related to the "cost" of using this model within our quota of requests.
So models with a `2x` beside them will cost twice as much as one with `1x`.

It's important to be clear on the relative cost,
since our quotas will be consumed more quickly with higher cost multipliers!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Asking Copilot to Suggest Improvements

10 mins.

Ensuring you have the `Ask` mode selected in the chat box:

- Select one of the `Claude Haiku 4.5` or `GPT-5 mini` models in the model dropdown.
- Choose a prompt to ask Copilot how to improve this code, e.g.:
   - `How can I make this code more readable?`
   - `How should I refactor this code to be more modular?`
   - `What can I do to improve this code?`

Repeat this for the other model types, asking the same exact question each time:

1. What answer does each model give you?
2. How are these responses similar?
3. How are these responses different?

Don't update your code with any of the suggestions just yet,
we'll come to this in the next episode.

Use any remaining time to explore asking other questions!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Following the exercise, talk through the possible solution to this below,
highlighting the key similarities and differences between each response.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

1.

For the question `How can I make this code more readable?` (your responses may differ!)

Note that, for each model, at the top of the response, it mentions three references are used:

- `copilot-instructions.md` - as we would expect
- `inflammation-01.csv` - since it's pattern is referenced in the source code
- `inflammation-plot.py` - since this is the file it's taken as context

Claude Haiku 4.5:

```
Your code can be made more readable by extracting the repetitive subplot pattern into a helper function and using a tuple/list to store the axes. Here's a refactored version:
```

```python
import glob

import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def plot_statistics(axes, data, stat_func, label):
    """Plot a single statistic on the given axes.
    
    Args:
        axes: Matplotlib axes object
        data: NumPy array of inflammation measurements
        stat_func: Function to compute statistic (e.g., data.mean)
        label: Y-axis label string
    """
    axes.set_ylabel(label)
    axes.plot(stat_func(axis=0))

filenames = glob.glob('../data/inflammation-*.csv')
filenames.sort()
filenames = filenames[0:3]

for filename in filenames:
    print(filename)

    data = np.loadtxt(fname=filename, delimiter=',')

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))
    axes = [fig.add_subplot(1, 3, i) for i in range(1, 4)]

    plot_statistics(axes[0], data, data.mean, 'average')
    plot_statistics(axes[1], data, data.max, 'max')
    plot_statistics(axes[2], data, data.min, 'min')

    fig.tight_layout()
    fig.savefig(filename + '.png')
```

```
Key improvements:

- Helper function eliminates the three identical ylabel/plot blocks
- List comprehension replaces axes1, axes2, axes3 variables
- Docstring documents the function's purpose and parameters
- Maintains all existing functionality and conventions from your codebase
```

GPT-5 mini:

```
Refactored file to improve readability (extracted helper, constants, main, axes list):
```

```python
# ...existing code...
import glob
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

FIGSIZE = (10.0, 3.0)
DATA_PATTERN = '../data/inflammation-*.csv'
FILE_LIMIT = 3

def plot_stat(ax, data, stat_func, ylabel):
    """Plot a statistic computed from data on ax."""
    ax.set_ylabel(ylabel)
    ax.plot(stat_func(data))

def main():
    filenames = glob.glob(DATA_PATTERN)
    filenames.sort()
    filenames = filenames[:FILE_LIMIT]

    for filename in filenames:
        print(filename)
        data = np.loadtxt(fname=filename, delimiter=',')

        fig = plt.figure(figsize=FIGSIZE)
        axes = [fig.add_subplot(1, 3, i + 1) for i in range(3)]

        plot_stat(axes[0], data, lambda d: d.mean(axis=0), 'average')
        plot_stat(axes[1], data, lambda d: d.max(axis=0), 'max')
        plot_stat(axes[2], data, lambda d: d.min(axis=0), 'min')

        fig.tight_layout()
        fig.savefig(filename + '.png')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
# ...existing code...
```

2.

Key similarities - both models:

- Refactored the duplicated `fig.add_subplot` generation into a Python list comprehension
- Refactored the duplicated `axes` set up into a separate function
- Added a docstring to the new function, albeit only a brief one with `GPT-5 mini`

3.

Key differences:

- Claude Haiku 4.5:
  - Defines constants for some of the hardcoded values
  - The high-level code is refactored into a `main()` function
  - Adds a `__name__ == '__main__'` condition guarding a call to the refactored `main()` function
- GPT-5 mini: the call to the refactored plotting function uses a `lambda` definition as an argument
  - Does not provide a textual summary of what it has done at the end

## Class Discussion: What are the Benefits and Risks?

10 mins.

Having used some of the features of Copilot,
what do you think are:

- The benefits are of using it? How do you think it would help you in your work?
- The risks of using it? What could go wrong?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

For this exercise, send out a shared notes document to the cohort (writable by everyone) that is split into two sections:
Benefits and Risks, so that participants can add their own comments to each category.
For each of these, allow them 4 mins to add comments and 1 minute to summarise the comments.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Possible benefits:

- Accelerates coding by generating boilerplate, scaffolding, and repetitive patterns
- Helps explore implementation options and alternative approaches quickly
- Assists with learning unfamiliar APIs, frameworks, and languages
- Improves consistency by mirroring local code style and conventions
- Speeds up refactoring, renaming, and small transformations
- Frees developer time to focus on higher level concerns

Possible risks:

- Discourages critical thinking
- Produce plausible but incorrect or incomplete code
- Subtly adapt code behaviour that is undesired and difficult to detect
- Suggest outdated or deprecated patterns
- Ignore project-specific requirements or architectural decisions
- Obscures rationale and decision-making responsibility
- Risks licensing or provenance uncertainty if not reviewed
- Reinfoce poor existing patterns in the codebase
- Can deskill developers if used uncritically

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Class Discussion: How Should we Mitigate These Risks?

5 mins.

What can we do to mitigate the risks we've identified?
How should we adapt our day-to-day development to accomodate these changes?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

For this exercise, in the shared notes document have a section for participants to add in answers.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

- Ensure suggested changes are throughly reviewed understood prior to their inclusion in the code
- Keep the context and scope of prompts (and their expression) to a minimum to accomplish a task,
to discourage large and/or complex suggestions that are difficult to understand
- In the case of refactored code, ensure suggested changes are throughly tested against the original version to ensure correct behaviour, i.e. manually, but also re-running a unit test suite if one exists and includes sufficient tests for the modified code
- Consider adding unit tests for AI-suggested changes or new features

Note that many of these changes are accepted best practice for code written manually;
but since much less of our own cognition is involved in this style of development,
adopting a more prudent and skeptical approach becomes even more important.

## Do Not Assign Rational where it Doesn't Exist

It's tempting to assign a reason why AI models are making certain suggestions.
However, it's importnat to note that there is no high-level rationale at all, despite appearances.

Copilot and similar tools are *suggesting patterns*, not *reasoning about intent* —
and that distinction really matters when you’re building software you’ll have to maintain into the future.
Remember that such tools can be confidently incorrect.

If you assume "Copilot must have chosen this for a good reason", you miss the critical step:
your own review and justification.

One way to consider Copilot is as a fast junior developer with infinite autocomplete and zero accountability!
Such tools are optimised for help, not correctness: suggestions still need human review.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## What's my Copilot Usage?

It's important to keep track of just how much of our Copilot "plan" we're using,
particularly since we're (by default) on the free tier of Copilot.
We can see an overview of what we've consumed and how much is remaining by selecting the Copilot icon
(on the left of the bell-shaped icon on the far bottom right of the status bar), e.g.

![Example Copilot usage overview](fig/copilot-usage.png)

So in this case, we can see that this user has consumed 0.3% of its quota for inline suggestions (which we'll look at later),
and 36% of the chat messages quota.
This allowance resets on a monthly basis, in this case February 23 2026.
